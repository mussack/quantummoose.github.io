I am a [graduate student](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/muss0080) in the Cognitive and Brain Sciences program at the University of Minnesota's Psychology department. I study computational psychology; meaning I use data science and modeling tools to study human behavior through both experiments and real-world data.

This summer I am instructor for an introduction to data analysis course for Psychology students; teaching how to perform and communicate basic statistical analysis. I've also taught research methods, major projects (a capstone course for psychology students), and lectured about Bayesian cognition.

My other interests include game design, science communication and history, and social justice.
