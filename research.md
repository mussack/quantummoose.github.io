{% newthought "My research" %} is focused on how people allocate their time to different tasks, and in the underlying computations the human motivational and cognitive systems use to solve this problem. How do people solve the decision to quit a task, and how do people integrate together cues from both the task and environment to make this decision? Also how do internal motives, in particular curiosity and mastery, integrate to decide the value and priority of a goal?

The different projects I am working on all share this focus on time allocation.

### Temporal decision making
What factors influence when people stop collecting information? We utilize a perceptual decision making task, detecting motion in a random-dot field, along with an optimal stopping diffusion model to investigate these factors which are both task relevant and irrelevant.

For these projects we collect both behavioral, EEG, and biometric (GSR and heart rate) signals. Our analysis uses MATLAB, R, and Python. This includes [FieldTrip](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/), [HDDM](http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/), [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/), partial least squares analysis, system identification, and survival analysis. We also are developing a Bayesian ideal observer model for the motion detection, in MATLAB.

### Spontaneous task switching
When do people decide to quit one task to engage in another?
