{% newthought "My research" %} is focused on understanding the motivational underpinnings of task engagement, and how people allocate their time to different tasks. What are the underlying computations people use to solve this problem? Also how do internal motives, in particular curiosity and mastery, integrate with environmental cues to decide the value and priority of a goal?

This page is forever in progress...

### Meta-cognitive decision making
How do higher level states of an agent (such as emotional states) impact how many resources they allocate to a task?

We utilize a perceptual decision making task, detecting motion in a random-dot field, along with the drift diffusion model to address this. People often have to trade off collecting more information versus waiting longer to make a decision. What factors influence when people stop collecting information?

For these projects we collect behavioral, EEG, and biometric (GSR, heart rate, and pupilometry) data. Data analysis and modeling is done in MATLAB, R, and Python.

### Time allocation and foraging
When an animal forages for food they must make a decision of how much time to spend in each patch before moving on. Foraging theory can be applied to a human's decision to quit a task by extending to more complex tasks and making connections with other scheduling theories.

### Video games and intrinsic motivation
By using recent advances in deep RL, we can model human performance in video games and predict when they will quit a game based on their ability to control, predict, and learn about the game.
