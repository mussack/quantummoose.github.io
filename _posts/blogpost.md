In video games the feeling of safety. In dark souls it's the bonfire, and they feel so warm and cozy. In Amnesia it's Agrippa, who would be creepy in another context.

This feeling of safety is important, for a number of reasons. In Left 4 Dead the developers talk about the ebb and flow of arousal. Most games do this anyways - have moments of intensity followed by calm. Movies also do this (and books http://hedonometer.org/books/v3/1777/). Why are these rhythms important?
