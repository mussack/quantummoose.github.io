{% newthought "Last summer" %} I taught _Introduction to Measurement and Data Analysis_ for psychology undergrads. I had previously been a section leader for the same course during a normal semester, and have been section leader for research methods and major projects a few times as well, so this was not my first experience teaching. However it was my first experience teaching a course completely on my own. There are many things I wish I had done differently, but overall I enjoyed the experience and learned quite a lot.{% marginnote "a" "This isn't a listical, but I'm keeping a list in sidenotes of important tips I have learned, not in order of importance." %}

I didn't create everything by myself. I used material from previous times the course had been taught, including the previous summer when another graduate student taught it{% sidenote "one" "Use material others have created, and properly give them credit for it. I got most of the assignments and tests from Brent Carpenter and Mark Stellmack" %}. Some of his material he got from the main instructor for the fall/spring course. Creating lectures and assignments takes a lot of time, and while I made my own lectures it was really useful to use material others had made.

One of the most useful things for me at the beginning of the course was to make a _course narrative_{% sidenote "two" "Create a course narrative, both for yourself and the students." %}. I took [this idea](https://www.universityaffairs.ca/career-advice/career-advice-article/syllabus-writing-storytelling/) mostly from Prof. Pachego-Vega (who you should follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/raulpacheco)), and it helped me shape what I wanted to teach and why. When I first started I had these rather grand visions about what a statistics course should teach.
{% marginnote "b" "I have a lot of opinions about the statistics we teach in these courses. NHST is an ok tool, but teaching them first I think hurts a student's longterm statistical learning. This might be a blogpost in of itself..." %} However I quickly realized that would require me to make a lot of new material for students, and would end up swamping my already high workload.

Assignments in particular take forever to make, especially the practice kind often used in math courses. To help with my workload (I didn't have a TA to help grade), I made all homework optional but had weekly quizzes. I tried my best to make the grading automatic, using the Moodle quiz feature. But I ended up overcomplicating it by having multiple versions of each question. This was meant to both reduce cheating and allow for students to retake the quizzes, but it essentially tripled my work. Since there was always some little error, I ended up having to grade many of the quizzes by hand anyways.

This was possibly the most difficult thing for me, especially given it was a math course. Many of the students, given this is psychology, had taken very little mathematics and had to review a lot of algebra.

One thing I did include was more time on graphics and newer statistical methods. I spend some time at the beginning covering Tufte's
- teach graphics
- teach programming?
- science communication
- spent a day on replicability
- little mistakes (give myself room)
- continuous learning (not get everything right initially.)
- enjoy practicing explaining concepts
