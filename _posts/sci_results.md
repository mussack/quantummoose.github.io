This summer I have been teaching introductory statistics for psychology undergrads, and we've recently finished up our discussion on hypothesis tests (well, some of them). While discussing what p-values where I had a student ask a rather interesting question; is there any sort of data that we can get that can completely reject the null, for certain? My answer was, in short, nope. We're always stuck with this uncertainty that science has to deal with. This was interesting to me given a recent article was published in Nature Behavior

The title I have for this post is far more extreme than I actually think, but the point is to emphasize a problem I have with some of the current approach towards the whole "replicability crisis" in psychology. There are many wonderful articles on this topic, and many really good people working on pushing open science, replicability, and open access overall{% sidenote "one" "I've recently joined my department's open science committee, so hopefully I can help more in pushing for this locally." %}. However, there's something I think overlooked by many of the pieces I've read.

- discuss uncertainty, statistical rethinking
- discuss scientist's as prophets, climate change and uncertainty.
  - policy requires certainty, but science requires uncertainty
- discuss post-modern skepticism, arguably more skeptical in an interesting way
  - why are we obsessed with 'facts'?
  - science gatekeeping might do more harm than good; who gets to be gatekeeper?
- in the end, what does science produce? What do we create? Does science actually produce facts, or is it some more complex knowledge building? Science is communal in it's basic terms.
- finally, how do we move forward and communicate? I think that open science is necessary to democratize science, to push past the idea of science as a culture but to deal sincerely with science as a profession that works with people. In the same way that politician is a profession, but everyone should be involved in policy, science is a profession but everyone is involved in knowledge building.
