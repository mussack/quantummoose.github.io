The goal of psychology, and essentially any behavioral science, is to provide some good theory that allows us to explain the behavior of humans. "Explain" here means a lot of things, and many researchers such as Marr, Tinbergen and Aristotle (if he counts) have described different types of explanations that we can provide. I've read a recent paper by Ortega and colleagues that provides a distinct summary of 2 very significant levels of explanation that coincide with thoughts I've been having on the issue:

> "The behavior of an agent is typically described in one of two ways: either *dynamically*, by
directly specifying the agent’s actions under any contingency; or teleologically, by specifying
a *variational* problem (e.g. a convex objective function) that has the agent’s policy
as its optimal solution. While these two descriptive methods can be used to represent the
same policy, the teleological description has a greater explanatory power because in addition
it encodes a preference relation which justifies why the policy was preferred over the
alternatives" [p7 in Ortega et al 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.06789v1.pdf)

While writing my prelim on motivation and cognition research, I've had similar thoughts that I want to summarize here, because it somewhat goes beyond what I should probably focus on in that review paper.

My Dad has a text from his physics undergrad days, on *Classical Dynamics* from Jerry Marion. There's a rather good discussion in it on the calculus of variations, that is essentially on methods for determining maxima and minima of a functional (which is like a function of functions). Variational principles are common in physics (think least action or Fermat's principle in optics), and generally describe how some object behaves based on some invariant property of it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_principle

Teleological principles rest on the use of mathematical optimization.

% describe the behavior, provide a simple summary, be able to predict what happens, be able to intervene and control what happens, or some vague sense of understanding.
