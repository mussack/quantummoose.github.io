I'm the kind of researcher that needs to include everything into my work as much as I can. Partially this is an excuse to not have to make real progress on projects, but mostly it's just the way my motivational system works. A big problem with that is that it can be hard for me to finish projects, and so this blog basically functions as me forcing myself to work through that.

Thinking through this reminds me of the Borges story The Aleph, which I suggest you [take the time](http://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/borgesaleph.pdf) to read. In it Borges finds himself in the apartment of a rival poet, who is both mediocre and successful, and who incidentally has the Aleph under the stairs in his basement.

> The Aleph’s diameter was probably little more than an inch, but all space was there, actual and undiminished. Each thing (a mirror’s face, let us say) was infinite things, since I distinctly saw it from every angle of the universe.

In this single point an impossible amount of space exists. I think I have this problem of shoving an {% m %} \aleph_1 {% em %} into my work, when a much smaller cardinality would do.
