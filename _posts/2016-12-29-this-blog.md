As a new blogger with Jekyll, one of my first posts is required to be about setting up this blog itself. Jekyll, as most things developed by programmers, is super easy and wonderful and magic and like sweet ambrosia.

Overall it hasnâ€™t been that bad of actually. Most of the guides are [pretty detailed](http://andybeger.com/2016/06/20/moving-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/), and walk you through most of the problems you might have.

This blog uses the [Tufte-Jekyll](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) theme, developed by Clay Harmon, which uses custom Liquid tags.
