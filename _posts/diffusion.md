title: "Drift diffusion model of decision making"
categories: research

This post is meant to summarize much of what I've learned about the drift diffusion model for two-alternative choice decision making and modeling human reaction time. There's a ton out there on modeling human reaction time (see Luce 1986 for example), and many other things on the diffusion model in particular, (see recent paper ~) but I'd like to summarize my perspective.

The diffusion model is an interesting example of a sort of process model that comes out of a more computational perspective.

 - signal detection theory
 - log likelihood ratio
 - dynamics from changes in the ratio
