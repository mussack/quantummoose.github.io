{% marginfigure 'mf-fig-1' 'assets/img/brainpaper.png' 'Playing with a *margin figure*. Here is a picture of my brain from a neuroimaging course I took.' %}
{% newthought 'I enjoy collecting'%} resources either for myself or for other people, in terms of links and other things that I think are useful for people. Currently this is all under construction as I have some fun remaking everything, but likely I will convert things from [my previous website](https://dominicmussack.wordpress.com/links/math-programming/) over to here.


## Blogposts

My plan is to put a lot of resource information into blogpost format, and things that I think are important to organize or whatever I will link to here. Though if I find that that's a useless site structure then eh whatever.
