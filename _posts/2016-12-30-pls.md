I've been doing partial least squares analysis for a while now, but I have still been learning about it. The core idea of PLS is really not complicated at all, but using it appropriately and fully understanding the model takes work.

So what's the core idea? PLS combines both principle components analysis and regression - instead of simply regressing Y against X, you find the best lower dimensions {% m %} Y_low {% em %} and {% m %} X_low {% em %} such that {% m %} Y_low {% em %} regresses against {% m %} X_low {% em %}.

Simply note PCA

Simply note regression

Now combine.

Provide an example used in brain sciences.

Now show the full model - remember that PCA and regression have models as well. Canonical correlation analysis is similar.
