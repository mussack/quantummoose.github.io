At the beginning of the *Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings* (the movie), Galadriel tells the story of the loss and finding of the Ring. This rather well done exposition goes from the creation of the rings of power to Bilbo finding the ring and ends by transitioning into the Long Expected Party, which is where the book starts. The book's prologue only features some Hobbit lore and reminds the readers of Bilbo's story, but doesn't detail the lost lore of the Ring. The reader isn't told this lore - it is something that Gandalf has to research.

While most viewers might not care, one of the things that interests me about *Lord of the Rings* is that one of the most important things Gandalf did was scholarship. The exposition from the movie shows in a few minutes what he took years (17!) to investigate. It's not until the Council of Elrond that Gandalf fully explains the backstory, after Galdor of the Havens asks for "proofs" that the Frodo's ring actually is the One Ring. It isn't actually obvious that Frodo's ring is important, given that there are other magic rings and other great rings as well. Taking a long quest against a powerful enemy could be worse than a waste of time if it's not the real Ring.

Gandalf revealed how he had searched for and questioned Gollum and what he learned from him. He filled in the details of Saruman's lore by scouring the records of Minas Tirith{% sidenote "one" "Many of these records are written in languages unknown by the lore-masters of the city" %}. All of this was necessary for him to push Frodo to start the Quest in the first place and to assemble the Fellowship.

Late at the end of *The Two Towers*, Gandalf recalls some Rhymes of Lore while riding to Minas Tirith with Pippin, regarding the Palantir{% sidenote "two" "*Tall ships and tall kings
Three times three,
What brought they from the foundered learned
Over the flowing sea?
Seven stars and seven stones
And one white tree.*" %} Treebeard also uses rhymes as mnemonics to remember creatures of Middle Earth{% sidenote "three" "*Learn now the lore of Living Creatures!
First name the four, the free peoples:
Eldest of all, the elf-children;
Dwarf the delver, dark are his houses;
Ent the earthborn, old as mountains;
Man the mortal, master of horses:*" %}.

I think what interests me about this view of lore is how knowledge seems to work in these books. In many fantasy works the author tells you the world through an omniscient lens, and you end up with a rather small world in the end since the world only exists of what the author knows. When there are things that the author *doesn't* know or leaves out, it can feel much more like a real world. This is something Neil Gaiman sometimes does very well.

This is also what makes *Roadside Picnic* such a wonderful story, as everything is completely unknown. Visitors came and left, leaving behind the Zones filled with terrible wonders which are marveled by scientists and stolen by stalkers. Of course in Tolkien's world the full history exists, but it's not directly known by the characters or the reader. In Gandalf's case there is a world filled with lore that can be researched rather than a world filled with mysteries that have to be experienced. It's almost the difference between humanities or journalism research and scientific research...
