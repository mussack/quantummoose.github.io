At the beginning of the *Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings* Galadriel tells the story of the loss and finding of the Ring. This rather well done exposition goes from the creation of the rings of power to Bilbo finding the ring, and transitions into the Long Expected Party, as the book starts. The book's prologue on the other hand only features some Hobbit lore and reminds the readers of Bilbo's story, but doesn't detail the lost lore of the Ring. The reader is not told this lore, as it is something that Gandalf has to research.

While most viewers might not care, one of the things that most interests me about *Lord of the Rings* is that one of the most important things Gandalf did was scholarship. The exposition that the movie shows you in a few minutes what he took years (17!) to investigate. It's not until the Council of Elrond that Gandalf fully explains.

In the Council of Elrond chapter, Galdor of the Havens asks for "proofs" that the Frodo's ring actually is the One Ring. This isn't obvious, given that there are other magic rings and other great rings as well. Taking a long quest against a powerful enemy could be worse than a waste of time if it's not the real Ring.

Gandalf revealed how he had searched for and questioned Gollum and what he learned from him. He filled in the details of Saruman's lore by scouring the records of Minas Tirith. Many of these records are written in languages unknown by the lore-masters of the city.

Rhymes of Lore

>Tall ships and tall kings
Three times three,
What brought they from the foundered learned
Over the flowing sea?
Seven stars and seven stones
And one white tree.
