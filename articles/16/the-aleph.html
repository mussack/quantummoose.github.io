      <h1>The aleph</h1>
<p class="subtitle">December 28, 2016</p>

<p>I’m the kind of researcher that needs to include everything into my work as much as I can. Partially this is due to how quick progress on an early part of a project is, which is just motivational candy for me. A big problem with that is it makes it harder to finish projects. So this blog basically functions as a way to force myself around that to some degree.</p>

<p>Thinking through this reminds me of the Borges story The Aleph, which I suggest you <a href="http://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/borgesaleph.pdf">take the time</a> to read. In it Borges finds himself in the apartment of a rival poet, who is both mediocre and successful, and who incidentally has the Aleph under the stairs in his basement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Aleph’s diameter was probably little more than an inch, but all space was there, actual and undiminished. Each thing (a mirror’s face, let us say) was infinite things, since I distinctly saw it from every angle of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this single point an impossible amount of space exists. I think I have this problem of shoving an <span>​<script type="math/tex"> \aleph </script></span> into my work, when a much smaller cardinality would do.</p>
